## Stationery Object

I'm ranking the world's hotels by their stationery. Once I have a sufficient collection, I'm publishing a book with the best examples and rankings.

Play along and contribute to this ranking. When you travel or pass by any interesting hotel, ask the front desk to see their stationery.

- Send 2 sets (2 sheets of their letterhead, 2 envelopes).
- On the second sheet, write your review and include your criteria for that review.
- Include your creative and specific criteria: rank the bar, the rooms, the quirks. Be specific.
- If I use it, I'll credit you and include a scan of your written review in the book.
- Once a hotel is submitted by you, no one else can claim that hotel in the book.
