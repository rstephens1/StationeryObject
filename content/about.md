For many years I traveled the world and started sending letters to my kids from each hotel. I started paying attention to the quality (or lack thereof) of hotel stationery. Increasingly, there are few artifacts that we can take with us as we travel. Maybe we are in the waning days of paper stationery at hotels? I hope not. Perhaps this project will reverse that trend. In an age of text messages, there's nothing more personal and powerful than a handwritten note, especially when you are traveling.
