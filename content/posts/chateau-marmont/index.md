note = "It was 1997, and I had never flown first class or even been to Los Angeles. Disney flew me out to pitch a Geek Squad movie after I fixed a producer's computer during The Mighty Ducks shoot in Minnesota. The movie never happened, but I still got the trip, the tour of Burbank, and a room at Chateau Marmont."

note = "My habit of keeping hotel stationery started earlier, when Charlie Watts showed me the notebook where he had sketched every hotel bed he had slept in since 1968. At Chateau, the first thing I noticed was a leather binder with this sheet inside. I kept these original pages from that trip, and they became the standard that inspired this entire project."

alt = "Chateau Marmont stationery image 3"

note = "This angle shows why the layout works so well: plenty of open space for letters, lyrics, contracts, or late-night notes. The mark is elegant without shouting. It feels tied to the architecture itself."

alt = "Chateau Marmont stationery image 4"
caption = "4"
note = "Held up to the light, the Strathmore Pure Cotton watermark appears. You can learn a lot from details like this: paper choice, texture, and print finish are part of the story. This is what keeps hotel stationery from feeling disposable."

alt = "Chateau Marmont stationery image 5"
caption = "5"
note = "This is the companion card: understated, formal, and beautifully printed on darker laid stock. Cards like this are usually for staff messages, but Chateau put them in the guest set, which says a lot about their standards. Even the secondary type choice is excellent."

alt = "Chateau Marmont stationery image 6"
caption = "6"
note = "Here is the pair together: card and matching envelope, both treated as essential, not optional. It feels like a complete writing kit, not a leftover amenity. These little decisions are what make a hotel feel intentional."

src = "07-photo.jpg"
alt = "Chateau Marmont stationery image 7"
caption = "7"
note = "A warmer angle, but the same core qualities: balanced letterhead, generous white space, and visible watermark. The paper carries the brand as much as the logo does. This is heirloom behavior in a disposable era."

src = "08-photo.jpg"
alt = "Chateau Marmont stationery image 8"
caption = "8"
note = "The envelope is crisp and restrained, with the address and mark doing just enough. You can imagine this leaving the desk with a handwritten note inside. It is a small object, but it carries the identity of the place."

src = "09-photo.jpg"
alt = "Chateau Marmont stationery image 9"
caption = "9"
note = "The facsimile cover sheet dates the set immediately and beautifully. You can see the transition era right in the typography and labels: old-world hotel, modern office utility. Most hotels dropped this long ago, which makes this artifact even better."

src = "10-photo.jpg"
alt = "Chateau Marmont stationery image 10"
caption = "10"
note = "This is the piece that still surprises me: a direct guest-feedback letter signed by Andre Balazs. It invites comments and makes customer listening feel personal, not procedural. Every CEO should study this move, on paper or otherwise."

alt = "Chateau Marmont stationery image 11"
caption = "11"
note = "The final image shows the feedback letter with its addressed return envelope to New York, complete with 34-cent stamps and a one-cent add-on. That tiny postal detail captures the era perfectly. For me, this set remains the benchmark: hospitality, design, and memory in one place."
