Still among the most interesting hotels, and with some of the best stationery of all.

This was the first piece I ever collected back in 1997 when Disney flew me to LA to pitch me on making a movie about The Geek Squad.

These are note cards as well, laid paper on thick card stock.

Bonus points for a visible watermark.
