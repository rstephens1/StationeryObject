**Location:** Downtown Los Angeles, California, USA

**Year opened:** 1927 (hotel conversion in 2014; Ace operation closed and rebranded in 2024)

Built as the United Artists Theatre Tower, this was less a hotel than a monument to old Hollywood self-mythology, then a sharp DTLA comeback story when Ace revived it in 2014. It was known for cathedral-scale interiors, a marquee social scene, and the theater's grand revival programming before the Ace chapter ended in 2024. The address is stitched into Los Angeles film history through United Artists and its founding orbit of Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Charlie Chaplin, and D.W. Griffith, and it remains one of the cleaner examples of adaptive reuse in the Broadway Theater District.
