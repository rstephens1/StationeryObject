**Location:** Adare, Ireland

**Year opened:** 1862 (converted to hotel in 1989; closed for restoration in 2016 and reopened in 2017)

Its 19th-century expansion is tied to local employment during hard economic years, and its current chapter is tied to J. P. McManus-era investment and global sports visibility.
