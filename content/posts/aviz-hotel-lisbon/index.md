**Location:** Lisbon, Portugal

**Year opened:** 1933 (closed in 1961; demolished by 1962)

The original Hotel Aviz no longer operates, but it remains part of Lisbon hotel lore, with period references tying the address to names such as Dwight D. Eisenhower, Maria Callas, and Eva Peron before redevelopment reshaped the district.
