**Location:** Palm Springs, California, USA

**Year opened:** 1933 (official and historical sources also cite 1929-era origins; rebranded as Avalon in 2015)

Before the Avalon sign went up, the property cycled through earlier identities, including the Viceroy chapter, but the through-line stayed the same: desert glamour built for fast Hollywood escapes.
